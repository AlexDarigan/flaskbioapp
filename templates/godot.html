<p class="content">Godot is a cross-platform, free and open-source game engine released under the MIT license.
    It was initially developed by Argentine software developers {{newtab("/juan", "Juan Linietsky")}} 
    and {{newtab("/ariel", "Ariel Manzur")}} for several companies 
    in Latin America prior to its public release.[8] The development environment runs on multiple operating systems
     including Linux, BSDs, macOS, and Microsoft Windows. It is designed to create both 2D and 3D games targeting 
    PC, mobile, and web platforms. It can also be used to create non game software, including editors.</p>
