WAT ( Waiting and Testing ) is the penultimate automated unit testing plugin for Godot developed by mo√≠.
I say penultimate because another plugin takes the top spot, largely thanks to first-mover advantage. My goal
in developing WAT was twofold; 1) I wanted to learn about Unit Testing and what better way than to develop a plugin
to automate it, 2) I wanted a Unit Testing Plugin that better integrated with the Engine as if it came built-in with it. 
After 3 years and 280~ stars on github, I would consider myself successful in this.
