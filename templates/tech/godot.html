<h1>{{Newtab("/godotengine", "Godot Engine")}}</h1>
<p class="content">
Godot is a FOSS (Free Open Source Software) Game Engine released under the MIT license. It was developed by {{Newtab("/juan", "Juan Linietsky")}}
and {{Newtab("/ariel", "Ariel Manzur")}} from Argetina. The scripting language, GDScript, was developed for the Engine. This hypothetically allows for
GDScript to be very effective for translating between the user-developer space and Godot's underlying API which is written in C++. The top two spots
of game engines go to Unity and Unreal respectively. Godot is an ever-growing strong contender for the third place, among others like GameMaker and GDevelop.
